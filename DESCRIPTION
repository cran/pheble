Description: A system for binary and multi-class classification of
    high-dimensional phenotypic data using ensemble learning. By combining
    predictions from different classification models, this package attempts
    to improve performance over individual learners. The pre-processing,
    training, validation, and testing are performed end-to-end to minimize
    user input and simplify the process of classification.
